pyinstaller no longer supports cross-compilation since 1.5:
https://groups.google.com/g/pyinstaller/c/veq3BlA_Bns

There are two solutions
1 Compile on Windows
2 Compile on Linux with Wine

Compile on Windows (Via Windows' Command Prompt):
1 Open Command Prompt
2 Check if pip3 is installed
  run: $ pip3 help
3 Check python
  run: $ python
  If this is unrecognized you need to install python 1st
  DO NOT install python from the Microsoft store, instead use:
  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/
4 Install pyinstaller
  run: $ pip3 install pyinstaller
5 Install Requirements:
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6 Run deploy.bat
  NOTE In general, running an untrusted .bat file is an awful idea.
  I would suggest looking through any bat files (via editing them) before running.
